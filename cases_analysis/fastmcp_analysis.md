    def handle_request(self, request: MCPRequest) -> MCPResponse:
        # Route request to appropriate server
        target_server = self.router.route(request)
        
        # Add proxy-specific logic (auth, logging, etc.)
        authenticated_request = self.authenticate(request)
        
        # Forward to target server
        response = target_server.handle(authenticated_request)
        
        # Post-process response
        return self.enrich_response(response)
```
