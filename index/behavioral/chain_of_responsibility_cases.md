# Chain of Responsibility Pattern in LLM Applications

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is perfectly suited for LLM applications where requests need to be processed through a series of handlers, each with specific capabilities and decision-making authority.

## Why Chain of Responsibility for LLM?

LLM applications often require:
- **Sequential processing**: Requests flow through multiple AI agents or processing stages
- **Conditional handling**: Different handlers for different types of queries or complexity levels
- **Flexible routing**: Dynamic decision-making about which agent handles what
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when primary handlers fail

## Key LLM Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Agent Request Routing
The most common application - routing user queries to specialized AI agents:

```python
class AgentChain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.first_handler = None
    
    def add_handler(self, handler):
        if not self.first_handler:
            self.first_handler = handler
        else:
            current = self.first_handler
            while current.next_handler:
                current = current.next_handler
            current.next_handler = handler
    
    def handle_request(self, query):
        if self.first_handler:
            return self.first_handler.handle(query)
        return None

# Specialized agents
math_agent = MathAgent()  # Handles math queries
code_agent = CodeAgent()  # Handles coding questions
general_agent = GeneralAgent()  # Handles everything else

chain = AgentChain()
chain.add_handler(math_agent)
chain.add_handler(code_agent) 
chain.add_handler(general_agent)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of agent responsibilities
- Easy to add/remove specialized agents
- Automatic fallback to general agent
- Request routing based on content analysis

### 2. Complexity-Based Processing Pipeline
Processing requests based on complexity levels:

```python
class ComplexityChain:
    def handle(self, query):
        complexity = self.analyze_complexity(query)
        
        if complexity == "simple":
            return self.simple_llm.process(query)  # Fast, lightweight model
        elif complexity == "medium":
            return self.medium_llm.process(query)  # Balanced model
        else:
            return self.advanced_llm.process(query)  # Most capable model

# Usage
simple_handler = SimpleQueryHandler()
complex_handler = ComplexQueryHandler()
research_handler = ResearchQueryHandler()
```

**Benefits:**
- Cost optimization (use cheaper models for simple queries)
- Performance optimization (faster responses for simple questions)
- Quality assurance (complex queries get the best models)
- Resource management

### 3. RAG Document Processing Chain
Processing documents through different retrieval and augmentation stages:

```python
class RAGChain:
    def process_query(self, query, documents):
        # Stage 1: Quick keyword search
        if self.keyword_handler.can_handle(query):
            results = self.keyword_handler.search(query, documents)
            if results.confidence > 0.8:
                return results
        
        # Stage 2: Semantic search with embeddings
        if self.semantic_handler.can_handle(query):
            results = self.semantic_handler.search(query, documents)
            if results.confidence > 0.7:
                return results
        
        # Stage 3: Full LLM processing with context
        return self.llm_handler.process_with_full_context(query, documents)
```

**Benefits:**
- Performance optimization for different query types
- Progressive enhancement of search quality
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- Adaptive resource usage

### 4. Content Moderation Pipeline
Processing content through multiple safety and quality checks:

```python
class ModerationChain:
    def moderate_content(self, content):
        # Stage 1: Basic content filter
        if self.basic_filter.is_inappropriate(content):
            return {"status": "blocked", "reason": "basic_filter"}
        
        # Stage 2: AI-powered toxicity detection
        toxicity_score = self.toxicity_detector.analyze(content)
        if toxicity_score > 0.7:
            return {"status": "flagged", "reason": "toxicity"}
        
        # Stage 3: Context-aware moderation
        if self.context_moderator.needs_review(content):
            return {"status": "review", "reason": "context_sensitive"}
        
        return {"status": "approved", "reason": "passed_all_checks"}
```

**Benefits:**
- Layered security approach
- Performance optimization (quick filters first)
- Detailed rejection reasoning
- Scalable moderation architecture

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery Chain
Managing failures and providing alternative responses:

```python
class ErrorRecoveryChain:
    def process_with_recovery(self, query):
        try:
            # Try primary AI service
            return self.primary_ai.process(query)
        except AIServiceError:
            try:
                # Fallback to secondary service
                return self.secondary_ai.process(query)
            except AIServiceError:
                # Final fallback to cached responses
                return self.cache_handler.get_similar_response(query)
```

**Benefits:**
- High availability and reliability
- Graceful degradation of service quality
- Multiple backup strategies
- User experience continuity
