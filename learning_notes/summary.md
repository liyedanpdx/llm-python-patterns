## ðŸ”§ Recent Workshop Completion

### Python Context Manager Workshop (2025-08-21)
A comprehensive 9-module workshop series on mastering Python Context Manager for LLM applications:

1. **Basic Concepts** - Core `@contextmanager` usage
2. **LLM Session Manager** - Production-grade session management
3. **Async Manager** - `@asynccontextmanager` for concurrency
4. **Smart Session** - `contextvars` global state management
5. **Nested Managers** - Multi-layer resource orchestration
6. **MCP Implementation** - Model Context Protocol detailed analysis
7. **AsyncExitStack vs @asynccontextmanager** - Advanced comparison
8. **Local MCP Integration** - Real-world multi-service scenarios
9. **Design Patterns Analysis** - Multi-pattern synergy and architectural insights

**Location**: `/workshops/context_workshop/`
**Key Learning**: Context Manager embodies multiple design patterns working in harmony - Template Method, Builder, Composite, Facade, Strategy, Observer, and Factory patterns collaborate to create enterprise-grade solutions.

**Design Pattern Insights**: Context Manager is not a single pattern but a sophisticated combination of multiple design patterns, representing the modern approach to enterprise software architecture where pattern synergy trumps pattern purity.
