# LLM Python Patterns
Python is an easy-to-use language for hands-on development but may not be as strictly structured as Java or C++ in enforcing coding rules and design patterns.

However, Python has become a powerful partner for LLM development, helping to build modern applications through frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, and LangExtract, and playing a significant role in modern application development.

Inspired by the [python-patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns) repo, this project demonstrates how classic design patterns solve real-world challenges in LLM applications. Through hands-on examples, enterprise case studies, and ready-to-use Claude Code templates, we explore practical implementations that enhance system robustness and maintainability.

We also aspire to enable Claude Code to systematically generate high-quality, pattern-based code by providing comprehensive templates and examples that can be intelligently combined for optimal AI system architecture.

## Workshop Projects

### 1. AI Agent Chain: Chain of Responsibility Pattern in Action - [ai_agent_chain_example.ipynb](./workshops/ai_agent_chain_example.ipynb)
   
   Notebook demonstrating how to build intelligent AI agent workflows using classic design patterns, similar to LangChain and LangGraph architectures.
   
   **Implemented Patterns:**
   - **Behavioral**: Chain of Responsibility, Strategy, Template Method
   - **Creational**: Abstract Factory (for different agent types)
   - **Structural**: Adapter (for API client abstraction)
   
   **Goal**: Build modular, scalable AI agent systems with proper separation of concerns
   
   **Similar Product Mindset**: LangChain agent workflows, LangGraph state machines, OpenAI Assistant API

### 2. JSON Schema Factory + Pydantic Validation: Structured LLM Output Control - [json_schema_factory_pydantic.ipynb](./workshops/json_schema_factory_pydantic.ipynb)
   
   Workshop showing how to get structured JSON from LLMs using Factory Pattern and Pydantic validation.
   
   **Patterns Used:**
   - Factory Pattern - Choose correct schema based on data type
   - Template Method - Standard prompt generation process
   
   **What it does:**
   - Takes any LLM output and validates it into clean JSON
   - Works with OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, or any LLM provider
   - Catches data errors before they enter your application
   - Alternative to OpenAI Function Calling with more control
