# python-pattern-playbook
Python is a language very easy for hands-on but may not be structured like Java or C++ to give us strict rules for coding and design patterns. Inspired by the [python-patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns) repo, we would like to implement some fun application achievements using design patterns directly in real-life projects to show their value in an easy-to-understand way.

Furthermore, Python is still a very strong language to cooperate with AI/LLM to help build modern applications by using frameworks like Langchain, Langgraph, Langextract, etc. So, how could we combine them together to give us a showcase of how a modern Python-based AI system should look like? It's also the direction we would like to approach.
